# ADO Pipelines

This is a collection of ADO pipeline drafts to build, push and deploy services in AWS ECS and Lambda.

It relies on [AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/vsts/) that can be installed from [ADO Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-vsts-tools)

All of contents here are still draft and I'm only keep them to be improved some day.... they simply works, not as best as it can be, but it works.
